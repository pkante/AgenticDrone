# TypeFly
TypeFly aims to generate robot task plan using large language model (LLM) and our custom programming language `MiniSpec`. Link to our [full Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COrozqEIk6v8DLxI3vCgoSUEWpnsc2mu/view) and [webpage](https://typefly.github.io/).

Also, check out the demo video here: [Demo 1: Find edible or drinkable items](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEJYaTLWKfY), [Demo 2: Find a specific chair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwnBniFaINE).

## Hardware Requirement
TypeFly works with DJI Tello drone by default. Since Tello drone requires your device to connect to its wifi and TypeFly requires Internet connection, you need to have both wifi adapter and ethernet adapter to run TypeFly.
To support other drones, you need to implement the `RobotWrapper` interface in `controller/abs/drone_wrapper.py`.

## OPENAI API KEY Requirement
TypeFly use GPT-4 API as the remote LLM planner, please make sure you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Vision Encoder
TypeFly uses YOLOv8 to generate the scene description. We provide the implementation of gRPC YOLO service and a optional http router to serve as a scheduler when working with multiple drones. We recommand using [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to run the YOLO and router. To deploy the YOLO servive with docker, please install the [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html), then run the following command:
```bash
make SERVICE=yolo build
```
Optional: To deploy the router, please run the following command:
```bash
make SERVICE=router build
```

## TypeFly Web UI
To play with the TypeFly web UI, please run the following command:
```bash
make typefly
```
This will start the web UI at `http://localhost:50001` with your default camera (please make sure your device has a camera) and a virtual drone wrapper. You should be able to see the image capture window displayed with YOLO detection results. You can test the planning ability of TypeFly by typing in the chat box. 

To work with a real drone, please disable the `--use_virtual_robot` flag in `Makefile`.

Here we assume your YOLO and router are deployed on the same machine running the TypeFly webui, if not, please define the environment variables `VISION_SERVICE_IP`, which is the IP address where you deploy your YOLO (or router) service, before running the webui.

## Task Execution
Here are some examples of task descriptions, the `[Q]` prefix indicates TypeFly will output an answer to the question:
- `Can you find something edible?`
- `Can you see a person behind you?`
- `[Q] Tell me how many people you can see?`
