Example 1:
Scene: []
Task: [A] Find a bottle, tell me it's height and take a picture of it.
Reason: no bottle instance in the scene, so we use scan to find bottle, then go and use object_height to get the height and log to output the height, finally use picture to take a picture of the bottle
Response: ?s('bottle')==True{g('bottle');_2=oh('bottle');l(_2);tp};

Example 2:
Scene: [apple_5]
Task: [A] Find an apple.
Reason: there is an apple instance in the scene, we just go to the apple_5
Response: g('apple_5');

Example 3:
Scene: [apple_3]
Task: [Q] Is there an apple and an orange on your left?
Reason: turn left 90 degrees, then use is_visible to check whether there is an apple on your left
Response: tu(90);?iv('apple')==True&iv('orange'){l('Yes');->True}l('No');->False;

Example 4:
Scene: [chair_13,laptop_2]
Task: [A] Go to the chair behind you.
Reason: the chair_13 is not the target because we want the one behind you. So we turn 180 degrees then go to the general object chair, since chair is a large object, we use 80cm as the distance.
Response: tc(180);g('chair');

Example 5:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_1,bottle_5]
Task: [A] Find and go any edible object.
Reason: edible object is abstract and there is no edible object in the scene, so we use scan_abstract to find the edible object
Response: _1=sa('Any edible target here?');?_1!=False{g(_1)};

Example 6:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] Turn around with 30 degrees step until you can see some animal.
Reason: we use loop and probe to find animal
Response: 12{_1=p('Any animal target here?');?_1!=False{l(_1);->True}tc(30)}->False;

Example 7:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] If you can see a chair, go find a person, else go find an orange.
Reason: From the scene, we can see a chair, so we use scan to find a person. Since person is a large object, we use 60cm as the distance
Response: _1=s('person');?_1==True{g('person');->True}->False;

Example 8:
Scene: [chair_3,laptop_9]
Task: [A] Go to 
Reason: The task is too vague, so we use log to output the advice
Response: l('Please give me more information.');

Example 9:
Scene: [chair_1 x:0.58 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7, apple_1 x:0.6 y:0.3 width:0.08 height:0.09]
Task: [A] Turn around and go to the apple
Reason: after turning around, we will do replan. We found that the chair is blocking the apple, so we use moving_up to get over the chair and then go to the apple
Response: mu(40);g('apple');

Example 10:
Scene: [apple_1 x:0.34 y:0.3 width:0.09 height:0.1, apple_2 x:0.3 y:0.5 width:0.15 height:0.12]
Task: [A] Go to biggest apple
Reason: from the scene, we tell directly that apple_2 is the biggest apple
Response: g('apple_2');
